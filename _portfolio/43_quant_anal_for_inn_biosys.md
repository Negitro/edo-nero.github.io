=====
This course focuses on the quantitative analysis of new design concepts, innovative ideas and technologies for biosystems. The leading question for the course is: Do innovative systems have a better integral sustainability performance than traditional systems?
The analysis of biosystems is performed at farm level or parts of it. Students work in small groups on real life case studies (dairy, fruit, broiler or arable farming). The course starts with an overview of sustainability themes, analysis of the case production system, and work towards relevant indicators for biosystems. Models and calculation tools are taught and applied to assess the performance with respect to environmental (ammonia emission, environmental impact points, or energy use), social (animal welfare, working conditions, or dust emission) and economic performance (net farm income). Sensitivity analysis is applied to determine the most important input variables and model parameters. Special attention is given to the limited availability and uncertainty of information and students have to consult experts and various information sources to make best-educated assumptions. Finally, students assess the integral sustainability performance, and make a trade-off analysis.
This is a first-year course in the MSc programme Biosystems Engineering (MBE). In week 2, the course includes an orientation on the study domain with a multiple-day full-day visits to relevant organizations, universities and industries in the Netherlands and surrounding countries. The students write a report about this field trip. The excursion is mandatory and takes place in combination with FTE33806 Biosystems Design.
For non-MBE students, only the whole day excursion on Monday is mandatory. Non-MBE students need to organise permission from their morning course to join. They will receive an additional assignment to replace the rest of the excursions activities.

Learning Outcomes
=====
After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:

Point out the relevant sustainability issues of selected biosystems
Collaborate responsibly in teams by identifying, encouraging, and assimilating contributions from diverse backgrounds (Boundary Crossing)
Apply relevant evaluation tools and models for the quantification of the various sustainability issues
Perform a sensitivity analysis on the sustainability issues of the selected biosystems
Interpret and reflect on the results of the sensitivity analysis
Compose alternative scenarios for the traditional and innovative production system with appropriate technical characteristics, and determine their sustainability performance
Present and justify an improved biosystem in a scientific report
Identify the work field of biosystems engineering

Activities
=====
- lectures;
- tutorials;
- case work in groups;
- multiple-day excursion. This excursion is mandatory for MBE students. One-day visits to innovative farms are required for this course. A replacement assignment of comparable workload is possible for non-MBE students.
