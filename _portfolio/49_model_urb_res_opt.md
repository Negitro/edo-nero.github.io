Contents
=====
The course aims to provide fundamental knowledge about mathematical programing and resource system modeling, to teach the student how to formulate an investment planning or operation scheduling decision-making problem as an optimization problem, and to enable them to interpret the simulation results and report the conclusion in capacity of a written report and oral presentation.

The course runs for 2 weeks and provides students a selection of basic and semi-advanced skills concerning mathematical optimization, physical system modelling and algorithmic implementation in common programming language(s), e.g. Python or Julia. The theoretical content on mathematical programming will be provided during the first week.
In the remaining of the course, special attention is given to the algorithmic implementation that will be practiced in computer assignments. Students will work on assignments in teams of two using the prototype codes that will be provided by the lecturer. There will be three separate and independent assignments each investigating a different decision making problem. The main focus here is on water and electricity systems. Multiple computer simulation practical are designed for the student to work on the projects under the close supervision of designated instructors. At the end of the course, an oral examination with the lecturer will take place to evaluate the following aspects:
(1) The ability to frame a given resource management question/challenge into a decision-making model or optimization problem.
(2) The ability to operate and implement a given prototype of code in computer environment to simulate the resource management challenges/problems and to generate quantitative results.
(3) The ability to interpret the modelling/optimization outcome built on existing scientific and practical knowledge in the field of resource/environmental management, especially concerning water and energy.

The course will be given at end of summer, mainly to prepare BSc/MSc students for their BSc/MSc thesis but also to provide other students a chance to follow this course without conflicting their courses in other periods.

Learning Outcomes
=====
After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:
classify different resource management problems and the associated mathematical models that are used in literature to study/solve them;
recognize which models are used to represent urban systems and explain the differences in their applications;
formulate resource management as a mathematical optimization problem;
implement a given resource management problem in a high-level computational simulation environment;
explain the results of a resource management simulation;
draw conclusions in terms of real-world practice e.g., decide on the best system improvement strategies for stakeholders based on model outputs considering technical and economic requirements/characteristics.

Activities
=====
interactive lectures and exercises;
computer tutorial session;
group computer project.
results presentation and follow up discussion
self-study (recap quizzes, e-module, literature).
