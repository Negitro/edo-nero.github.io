=====
The content of the course focuses on engineering aspects of greenhouse horticulture systems in interaction with crop growth and development. In a general introduction an analysis of the sector will be presented, followed by the basics of crop growth and development and the physical principles of the greenhouse climate. The main in depth topics of the course are: physics of greenhouse climate, crop production (biological mechanisms, crop growth and development, crop responses to growth factors), management of the aerial environment (functions, manageable parameters and greenhouse climate engineering: radiation management, energy sources and distribution systems, ventilation, air conditioning and cooling systems, screens, carbon dioxide-sources and distribution), management of the root environment (factors, tools, control of water and mineral balance, water quality, salinity effects), and greenhouse systems (passive, climate controlled, (semi) closed greenhouse, greenhouse types, cover materials, and crop systems). The course puts emphasis on calculation and analysis. It prepares for a thesis in greenhouse engineering.
As a student you will be confronted with systems, theoretical backgrounds and methods that are generally used in analysis of the topics mentioned. You will learn to understand and apply theory, and to analyse problems given to you during the course. Both in exercises (manual exercises and model based exercises) and in trainings on a deeper problem analysis by means of simulation, you will be trained in methods to analyse, predict and evaluate crop production, greenhouse climate, and performance of climate engineering solutions, including integration of these fields of knowledge. Focus is not only on the Dutch situation but also on the international protected cultivation. In an excursion near the end of the course you will visit several locations to see and understand implementations of the learned matter.
