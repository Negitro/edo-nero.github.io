The course Microalgae Biotechnology is aiming for an improved understanding on the cultivation of microalgae and cyanobacteria in photobioreactors and raceway ponds. In this course it is implicitly assumed that it is known which are potential applications of algal biomass, and what type of products potentially can be made using microalgae and cyanobacteria as biocatalysts. The term biotechnology does not relate to genetic aspects surrounding the application of microalgae and cyanobacteria. In this course the term biotechnology relates to the technical aspects surrounding the cultivation of these microbes. It is assumed that the students following this course have affinity with technical concepts related to chemical engineering. In addition, it is assumed that the students have basic knowledge on engineering concepts as mass balancing and setting up rate equations for biological processes.
As a student you will learn the peculiarities related to growing microbial cells which depend on light as their main source of energy. The relation between light and photosynthetic growth in bioreactors will be discussed in detail allowing you to assess the potential of this process and to take part in the design of light-driven bioprocesses. Besides the aspects surrounding the use of light, also other engineering issues will be discussed. Among others: gas-liquid transfer of gaseous products (oxygen and carbon dioxide), chemical reaction equilibria and reaction stoichiometry. These topics are also part of other BPE courses within the Biotechnology curriculum (for example BPE-21306 Bioreactor Design), and therefore those topics will not be covered in great detail. This part of the theory is only repeated to be able to connect the most important design questions to the use of sunlight.
This course is a restricted optional for the MSc Biotechnology, Biobased Sciences, and Plant Sciences. It is especially interesting for students who want to learn more about alternative strategies for the production of microbial biomass, or higher plant biomass. Because large-scale production of microalgal biomass is still in its infancy this course does not have a direct relation with a large industrial community. This course is given by Bioprocess Engineering to prepare students for the possible future application of this technology.
