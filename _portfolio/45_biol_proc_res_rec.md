Contents
The subject of this course is the exploration of microbiological opportunities to recover resources within Environmental Technology, thereby closing material cycles with minimal losses. Thermodynamic, microbiological and biotechnological unified principles are used to assess the viability of those opportunities for application in practice. Viable opportunities are developed into technological concepts working at optimal energy conditions.
Learning Outcomes
After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:

Assess the thermodynamic feasibility of biological reactions for resources recovery under actual conditions
Assess the microbial biomass yield of biological reactions for resources recovery
Evaluate substrate properties (toxicity, bioavailability, biodegradability) for their effect on biological processes for resource recovery
Calculate the dimensions of bioreactors used for resource recovery
Explain biofilm theory and use the equations involved
Explain how biological processes can be used to produce recyclable crystals and minerals, and be able to use the involved mathematical relationships
Use the acquired knowledge to design a biological process to steer the microbial competition for substrates in mixed cultures in such a way that desired reactions occur

Activities
- attending the lectures;
- literature research;
- studying the theory and work on a case study in a group.
