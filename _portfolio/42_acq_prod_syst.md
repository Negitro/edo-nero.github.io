Contents
=====
This course deals with the relation between aquatic organisms (algae, fish, crustaceans, molluscs) and their environment, the latter comprising the direct production space and the wider environment in which farms operate. The main aspects of aquaculture systems (extensive and intensive) are addressed considering effluents, water quality management, husbandry (e.g. stocking density, feeding strategies) and overall farm design. A lot of attention is given to biological water quality control though photo- and heterotrophic processes in natural waters or in purpose-build reactors. The focus is on how farm system components and management options determine farming success and sustainability. During the course, the students build and operate recirculating aquaculture production systems, relying on different types of bioreactors. The contribution of each bioreactor to the nutrient balance in systems is analysed, and compared with other bioreactors. This knowledge is applied in the design of a fish farm, including effluent control and management, and dealing with both intensive and extensive types of farming.

Learning Outcomes
=====
After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:

Identify biological, physical and chemical processes occurring in water and integrate them into the design of sustainable aquaculture production systems
Apply and control the main biological processes affecting water quality in aquaculture production systems
Calculate the carrying capacity for any type of aquaculture production system, considering productivity, animal health and wellbeing, and optimize the management of the unit accordingly
Design and operate recirculating aquaculture systems
Make nutrient mass balances of aquaculture production systems, and integrate them with other aquatic or terrestrial farming activities as part of integrated farming systems
Apply the principles governing management of aquaculture production systems to the maintenance and design of man-made aquatic ecosystems

Activities
=====
- lectures;
- practical exercises (operating/managing recirculation systems containing fish);
- tutorials (design production systems).
