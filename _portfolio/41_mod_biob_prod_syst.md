=====
Mathematical models are a powerful tool to predict and improve the performance and behaviour of novel biobased production systems, aimed at providing society with food, fuel, and biomaterials in the post fossil fuel era.
This course discusses how to develop mathematical models using the System Dynamics approach. This approach is often used to simulate complex models with non-linear behaviour, based on pre-existing knowledge from physics, chemistry and biology. To learn this approach, students work in teams on computer practical cases. The cases consist of a crop production system divided into sub-systems.
In this course, students learn to analyse critically mathematical models available in literature, in order to reproduce and connect them to perform system-level simulations. These simulations are oriented towards answering specific research questions.
The course covers different tools for model implementation. First, models are represented in Forrester diagrams, common in System Dynamics. These diagrams are then implemented in a graphical simulator. Finally, the models are coded into a programming language.
Students are guided through common steps in the development of mathematical models, with a focus on complex biosystems: formulating research questions, gathering data and models from literature, writing and solving differential equations, sensitivity analysis, model calibration, model validation, and uncertainty analysis

Learning Outcomes
=====
After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:

Collaborate responsibly in teams by identifying, encouraging and assimilating contributions from diverse backgrounds (Boundary Crossing)
Recognize the relevance and limitations of mathematical modelling as a tool for science and engineering

Interpret and translate complex descriptions of biological systems into mathematical models
Identify and classify variables in the mathematical notation of System Dynamics
Represent graphically a mathematical model in a Forrester diagram
Apply sensitivity analysis, model calibration, and uncertainty analysis
Implement mathematical models in a programming language, splitting them into sub-models for analysis, and connecting them for complex system-level simulations
Assess and verify the accuracy of model simulations against literature data
