Contents
=====
Current societal transitions, including the change from fossil fuel-driven towards renewable based processes, require innovative (electrified) technologies for (drinking) water treatment and resource recovery. Furthermore, there is an increasing need for large-scale energy storage systems. This course will cover the fundamental aspects of electrochemical engineering, including the principles of an electrochemical cell, electrode processes and materials, transport mechanisms in (ion exchange) membranes, and electrochemical measurements. Furthermore, the course captures innovative and state-of-the-art electrochemical processes for water treatment, energy storage, resource recovery. We discuss the theory and application of (flow) batteries, supercapacitors, (microbial) fuel and electrolysis cells, and of electrochemical desalination, separation, disinfection, electroplating, and corrosion processes.

Learning Outcomes
=====
After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:

Explain fundamentals/basics of electrochemical engineering, including faradaic and capacitive electrode processes, electro-interfacial phenomena, Nernst and Butler-Volmer theory, and important properties of electrolytes
Interpret the dynamics of (bio-)electrochemical systems, including ion transport in (ion exchange) membranes (Nernst-Planck theory)
Characterize environmental (bio-)electrochemical systems based on experiments, data interpretation and calculations
Evaluate the performance, potential and limitations of environmental electrochemical technologies
Design an electrochemical process for water treatment, energy storage or resource recovery, taking into account the complex composition of (water) streams

Activities
=====
Attending lectures, doing assignments and studying literature to acquire knowledge on the principles of electrochemical engineering and electrochemical technologies and processes. Furthermore, the course will include a computer practical training (Excel or Matlab) to perform advanced calculations on electrochemical technologies (approx. 24 hours). Lastly, you will work in small groups on your own design of an environmental electrochemical process.
