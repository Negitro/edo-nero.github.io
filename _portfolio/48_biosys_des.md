=====
In the course students will apply a structural engineering design method to a biosystems engineering related design problem with a focus on system innovation. Sustainability aspects, that is ecological, economic and social aspects, play an important role in the design process. The problems / cases in this course are more complex and on a higher systems level than in the course Engineering Design (FTE-24806). The design methods taught in FTE-24806 are extended with new ones. Knowledge on the design methods taught in FTE-24806 is not mandatory, it can be made up for during the course.
The structure of the course is based on Reflexive Interactive Design, with main steps 1) system and actor analysis and 2) structured design. Methods in systems engineering and in Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) like Technology Landscaping, Innovation Trend Analysis and resolving Design Contradictions are taught. The course includes an extensive state-of-the-art analysis (based on intellectual property (IP)-research, knowledge research, market exploration). Also the organisation of a design project gets attention.
Some typical examples of technological innovations in biosystems are presented, discussed and studied. Students will spend most of the course time on applying the theory, the methods and the ideas behind it to their own design case. Students write a group report on the design case.
The case is meant to develop competence in contributing to design teams at the level of:
- problem analysis (analysing the need and setting the design objective);
- generating and evaluating stakeholder requirements and design constraints;
- function analysis of hybrid systems or new systems;
- IP-research (able to perform a state-of-the-art analysis for a design case);
- generating working principles with functions and manage proven solutions;
- proposing well-founded design concepts;
- evaluating their compliance with the given requirements;
- presenting and passing on design concepts through visual, oral and textual expression.
The course includes an orientation on the study domain with a multiple-day field trip to relevant organizations, universities and industries in the Netherlands and surrounding countries. The students write a report about this field trip.

Learning Outcomes
