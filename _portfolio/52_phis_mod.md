Contents
=====
Nowadays computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques become more and more integrated into the design of technical bio systems. In addition to this, CFD is also used in the analyses of complex environmental problems. The result of this is that an increasing amount of life science applications of CFD appears in literature with a focus on flow visualization, calculation of heat losses and concentration profiles. In order to have some insight into CFD techniques, in this course we start with traditional physical modeling issues as: balance equations, analogy between heat-mass-momentum, dimension analysis, convection-diffusion with sink/source terms, Navier-Stokes equation and an illustration of numerical schemes. The physical modeling exercises will be implemented on a computer, using Matlab and its PDE toolbox, and tested on experimental data.

Learning Outcomes
=====
After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:

Understand and apply the principles of transport phenomena (for mass, energy, momentum) in a spatially explicit and dynamic setting
Abstract a real system into a physical model (consisting of partial differential equations)
Implement and analyze physical models using dedicated softwares (such as Matlab)
Apply CFD techniques to own research case or a given case

Activities
=====
- self-study to prepare for the lectures, tutorials and computer cases;
- lectures and tutorials;
- computer cases including preparation, performing, analysing and reporting;
- implementation of physical models in Matlab;
- research case in own field in groups of 2-3 persons
